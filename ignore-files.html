<div class="container">

# {{page.title}}

After executing `quickshot configure` and selecting `Configure ignore file` you will be presented with the following menu:

```
? What would you like to use as the quickshot ignore file? (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ .gitignore
  .quickshotignore
```

You may want to ignore files such as `settings_data.json` which contain data that could have been edited via Shopify's web admin panel that you don't want to overwrite using commands like `quickshot watch` (especially when working in multiple stores).

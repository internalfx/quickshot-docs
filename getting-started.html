### The configuration wizard

The configuration wizard will guide you through creating your quickshot.json file. **You do not need to make or edit this file by hand!** (but you certainly can if you wish).

*Also note the configuration wizard is designed be run multiple times. If you want to change your configuration, just run it again!*

Navigate to the directory where your theme files live, or where you'd like them to be, and execute the following command:

`quickshot configure`

## Using Configuration Wizard

The configuration wizard will guide you through creating your `quickshot.json` file. It is designed to be run multiple times, so anytime you want to change your config file, just run it again! *You do not need to make or edit this file by hand â€” but if you'd like to, see below.*

> Navigate to the directory where your theme files live, or where you'd like them to be, and execute the following command:
>
> `quickshot configure`

## Manual `quickshot.json` Creation

If you'd like to manually create the JSON file, below is an example `quickshot.json` file for your reference.

```json
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "target_name": "live",
      "api_key": "b33284d24bcfcce6d3f6946e573e29ef",
      "password": "b56abe15f189302423b826bc41a3aedb",
      "domain": "quickshot-docs",
      "theme_name": "Quickshot Docs Theme",
      "theme_id": 20124355
    }
  ],
  "configVersion": 1
}
```

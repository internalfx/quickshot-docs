    Quickshot has the ability to compile SCSS before uploading to Shopify. This can make your workflow easier, and keep your pages loading fast by only needing to include one css file in `theme.liquid`.

Execute `quickshot configure` and select `Configure scss` from the main menu.

```
? Main Menu:
  Configure targets
‚ùØ Configure scss
  Configure ignore file
  Save configuration and exit
```

You will then be asked if you want to enable SCSS compilation.

```
? Would you like to enable automatic compiling for scss files? (y/N)
```

Press `y`. Then you will be asked what file to use for your primary SCSS file. If unsure accept the default.

```
You have enabled scss compiling.

The filename entered below will be recompiled anytime ANY scss file changes while using 'quickshot watch'.
The file will be created for you if it does not exist.
You will want to put all your @import calls in that file.
Then in your theme.liquid you will only need to include the compiled css file.

See docs at {{site.url}}{{page.url}} for more information.
? Enter relative path to primary scss file. (assets/application.scss)
```

### General SCSS Usage

**These instructions assume the default settings were used**

For this example lets assume you have 3 CSS files in your project.

```
main.css
navigation.css
typography.css
```

After running the `quickshot configure` we now have

```scss
application.scss
main.css
navigation.css
typography.css
```

Rename all your css files to have a `.scss` extension

```scss
application.scss
main.scss
navigation.scss
typography.scss
```

Then edit your `application.scss` similarly to below.

```scss
@import "main";
@import "navigation";
@import "typography";
```

When compiled this will create one `application.css` file containing all your merged css styles. Now we just need to include this in our `theme.liquid` file.

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
  <!-- application.css is recompiled and uploaded anytime you change ANY .scss file in your project. -->
  {% raw %}{{ 'application.css' | asset_url | stylesheet_tag }}{% endraw %}

  {% raw %}{{content_for_header}}{% endraw %}
</head>
```

After that you can use all the benefits of SCSS! For more information on what you can do check out the [Sass documentation](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE)

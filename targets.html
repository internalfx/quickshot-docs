      ### Configure Targets

      To configure your targets select "Configure targets" using your arrow keys and press enter. You will then see the following menu.

      ```
      ? Manage Targets: (Use arrow keys)
      ❯ Create Target
        Edit Target
        Delete Target
        List Targets
        Done Managing Targets
      ```

      #### Create Target

      Select `Create Target` from the menu using the arrow keys.
      You will then be asked for all of the following information:

      - **Target Name** - *Staging, Development or whatever you wish*
      - **API Key** - *Copied from the Private Apps Settings page in Shopify*
      - **Password** - *Copied from the Private Apps Settings page in Shopify*
      - **Store URL** - *URL to the Shopify store you want to connect to (quickshot only needs the subdomain)*
      - **Theme** - *Quickshot will display all the available themes from your shop, use your arrow keys to select which one you want to connect to*

      > #### Private Apps Settings?
      >
      > If you're wondering what those are, go to **your-store.myshopify.com**/admin/apps/private in your web browser. Click on “Create a Private App” to generate the credentials for a new app. Quickshot, will need the **API Key** and **Password** of this newly generated app:
      >
      > ![api-key-and-password](images/API-key-and-password.jpg)
      >
      > *Special Thanks to Shopify for letting me use some of their documentation*

      After configuring a target, you are returned to the `Manage Targets` menu. From there you can edit, delete, and display a list of all configured targets. If you are finished adding targets select `Done Managing Targets` to continue.

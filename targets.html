      After executing `quickshot configure` you will be presented with the following menu:

      ```
      ? Main Menu: (Use arrow keys)
      ❯ Configure targets
        Configure sass
        Configure ignore file
        Save configuration and exit
      ```

      To configure your targets select "Configure targets" using your arrow keys and press enter. You will then see the following menu.

      ```
      ? Manage Targets: (Use arrow keys)
      ❯ Create Target
        Edit Target
        Delete Target
        List Targets
        Done Managing Targets
      ```

      Select `Create Target` from the menu using the arrow keys.

      You will then be asked for all of the following information:

      - **Target Name** *Staging, Development or whatever you wish*
      - **API Key** *Copied from the private app settings page on Shopify*
      - **Password** *Copied from the private app settings page on Shopify*
      - **Store URL** *URL to the shopify store you want to connect to*
      - **Theme** *quickshot will display all the available themes from your shop, use your arrow keys to select which one you want to connect to*

      #### Getting Private App Credentials

      Go to **your-store.myshopify.com**/admin/apps/private in your web browser. Click on “Create a Private App” to generate the credentials for a new app. You will need the API Key and Password of this newly generated app:

      *Special Thanks to Shopify for letting me use some of their documentation*

      After configuring a target, you are returned to the `Manage Targets` menu. From there you can edit, delete, and display a list of all configured targets. If you are finished adding targets select `Done Managing Targets` to continue.

        ### Whats a target?

        A `target` is a specific theme at a specific shop.

        Targets are a means of directing where quickshot sends your files.

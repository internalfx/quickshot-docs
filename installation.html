### TL;DR;

`npm install -g quickshot`

### Verbose

Quickshot is written in Iced CoffeeScript and runs on node.js and io.js.

If you have neither of those installed visit https://nodejs.org/download/

After installing one of the above, open a terminal and run `npm install -g quickshot`

If you have errors, you may need to run the above command with `sudo`. Try `sudo npm install -g quickshot`
